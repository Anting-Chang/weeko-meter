Live Demo: https://anting-chang.github.io/weeko-meter
```
I used the free tie in heroku, so the first login might take up to 30 seconds
as the server shuts down after 30min of unuse. (Its free....so)
```

## Tech used

Front-end: react
Back-end: nodejs
Database: mongodb

Front-end validation: fornik
Front-end Ui library: Bootstrap-react

Used jwt when login.

Back-end: axios, express-validator, jsonwebtoken, mongoose

#### Deploy
- Github page
- Heroku
- mongodb Atlas

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose of the website

Encourage myself to live my life in its all fullness. The app shows every single week of the life in as a little cube, reminds me of each passing week.

## How to use

Click on the cube to create a journal for that week. Or that quarter Or that year. 

### Colors?

Choose the color of the cubes! If I think I have done my best. I will choose the darkest color and if life is kind of boring, I will just choose the lighter ones. And yes! You can customize the color palletes. Still developing tho. Its already managed by redux so I only need to finished the server part.

## Mobile ?

Yes~! It supports mobile. However only the most recent 5 year would be shown for preformance reasons. And on the mobile I can't see my life in one page anyway so there is no point. It's a lot convenient though as I can pick up my phone and just make a journal of my week.

## Progress ?

This app is 90% complete. I am really happy about it. All major functionalities are done. This app is only for personal use. And if you signup and write a journal on there. I can actually see it in the database so don't do it. Passwords are hashed, journal are not lol.
